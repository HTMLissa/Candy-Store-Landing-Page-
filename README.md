# Candy-Store-Landing-Page-

This project came up while following along with the Odin project. Based on a template, a flex layout had to be recreated.

This opportunity allowed me to deepen my skills and knowledge in Flexbox and get a better feel for how product landing pages could be built.

I was also able to get creative in CSS when choosing colors, fonts, and details.

Credits to the amazing artists without whom this site wouldn't be nearly as colorful:
